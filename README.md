# My notes for last exam

## Abstract
This document [my_ml1_notes_staifmatej.pdf](my_ml1_notes_staifmatej.pdf) is a collection of notes in Czech language for preparation for the exam from the subject Machine Learning 1 (BI-ML1) at CTU FIT (winter semester 2025/26). The text is a synthesis of information presented at lectures, but I created it independently by myself. I declare that the text itself was not generated using LLM. If you find any errors please use issues or contact in the header of the document.

## Notice
- Each section marks and highlights under the heading which oral exam question the chapter belongs to! This way I processed all questions for oral exam.

- In my notes I added a chapter with title: *"Zajímavá videa na YouTube"*, where I added links to interesting videos on YouTube. These are videos which helped me understand the material more in depth and maybe also more intuitively, and therefore I also recommend these videos to the kind reader.
- In the second to last chapter with title: *"Zajímavá videa na YouTube přesahující rámec kurzu"* I added links to interesting videos on YouTube which go beyond the scope of the course (or belong to the follow-up summer course Machine Learning 2), but they are really great and belong among my favorite videos and maybe they will also help someone else to expand their horizons.
- The last chapter contains a summary of all formulas which are in my opinion crucial for passing the oral exam. It is not a summary for memorizing all needed formulas, but rather for a quick look and check that the kind reader can derive every formula.

## Author's Note

I wrote these notes myself to prepare for the exam as best as possible, because for me it was not just about passing, but to understand everything in depth. I am convinced that there are minimal errors in the document, but still if you find some error, whether grammatical or otherwise, then please report issues here in this repository, or write me an email, but I prefer issues here in the repo!
